# 😎 Hey!<br />

I am Mostafa Hussein, I have a passion for engineering, coding, working with hardware. To add on, I mainly enjoy using Arduino, 
making circuits, coding fun games (using Unity mainly), and recently I picked up the basics of python. Currently, I am exploring a few python libraries, 
such as PySerial, OpenCV, and more. Other than that, I enjoy mathematics, physics, computer science, and computer engineering!
